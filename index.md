# Welcome to the Stardot Community Site

Lets put some helpful information here.

The big idea is to have a simple way to present information about the github projects we have within the Stardot Github organisation.

It might also be a useful way to collect other information that is helpful to the community for Acorn development and related topics.

This entire site is a structured set of markdown files, all stored in a single repository. This is a more tangible and preservable format than using GitHub wiki, since it can be easily cloned and content can be easily authored.

# Contributing to this site

This site is hosted using Github Pages. It uses a Jekyll theme called "Just the docs", which is a very simple and lightweight means of presenting hierarchical markdown-based content.  

The simplest way to edit existing content is by directly editing mark down files in the `docs` folder directly in the Github browser app.

Alternatively, clone the repository and add content that way. The theme files themselves should not need editing when adding content, rather, new folders and `.md` files can be simply added inside the `/docs` folder, and when pushed back to the Github repo, they will appear automatically. 

[You can view documentation for the theme here.](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs)

The theme itself supports a number of cute customisations which aren't actually markdown format, so for the most part we would recommend that writing documents in plain markdown will in most cases be perfectly fine and much easier to work with.
